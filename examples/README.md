# Examples

Configuration examples organized by category.

## Running an Example

```console
cargo run -p praxis-ai-proxy -- -c examples/configs/openai/responses/full-flow.yaml
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

Configs use local ports (`3000`, `3001`, ...) for
upstreams — start a real backend or stub on those ports
before sending requests.
