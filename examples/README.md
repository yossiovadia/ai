# Examples

Configuration examples organized by category.

## Running an Example

```console
cargo run -p praxis-ai-proxy -- -c examples/configs/openai/responses/full-flow.yaml
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

Configs use local ports (`3000`, `3001`, ...) for
upstreams — start a real backend or stub on those ports
before sending requests.

| [unified-gateway.yaml](configs/anthropic/unified-gateway.yaml) | Routes traffic by classifier-promoted headers so a single listener handles Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses requests |

### OpenAI

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| [conversations.yaml](configs/openai/conversations/conversations.yaml) | Local /v1/conversations endpoints for conversation lifecycle, backed by the ConversationItemStore |

| [file-resolve.yaml](configs/openai/responses/file-resolve.yaml) | Resolves `file_id` and `file_url` references in Responses API input by fetching file metadata and content, then inlining base64 content as `file_data` or `image_url` before forwarding |
| [format-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/format-routing.yaml) | Routes AI API traffic by detected body format |
| [full-flow.yaml](configs/openai/responses/full-flow.yaml) | Combines conversations, format classification, request validation, file resolution, and backend routing into a single pipeline |

| [mcp-tool-resolve.yaml](configs/openai/responses/mcp-tool-resolve.yaml) | Demonstrates the `openai_mcp_tool_resolve` filter, which resolves MCP tool entries in the Responses API `tools` array into concrete tool definitions by calling `tools/list` on each upstream MCP server |
| [model-rewrite.yaml](configs/openai/responses/model-rewrite.yaml) | Rewrites or injects the top-level `model` field in Responses API request bodies before forwarding to the inference backend |
| [rehydrate.yaml](configs/openai/responses/rehydrate.yaml) | Validates `previous_response_id` by fetching the stored response, confirming its status is completed, and promoting the ID to filter metadata |
| [request-validate.yaml](configs/openai/responses/request-validate.yaml) | Validates Responses API JSON and enriches request metadata |
| [response-store.yaml](configs/openai/responses/response-store.yaml) | Persists non-streaming Responses API responses to a database and serves stored data via GET endpoints and handles DELETE /v1/responses/{id} locally |
| [responses-proxy.yaml](configs/openai/responses/responses-proxy.yaml) | Proxies OpenAI Responses API requests to a native /v1/responses backend |
| [responses-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/responses-routing.yaml) | Routes Responses API traffic by detected mode |
| [stream-events.yaml](configs/openai/responses/stream-events.yaml) | Demonstrates the `openai_stream_events` filter, which observes SSE chunks from the backend without modification, accumulates state (response object, output items, tool calls, usage), and writes it to ResponsesState metadata |
| [tool-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/tool-routing.yaml) | Demonstrates using `openai_tool_parse` to route Responses API requests by their tool composition |
| [vector-stores-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/vector-stores-routing.yaml) | Routes /v1/vector_stores traffic and all its subresources to a dedicated backend (any server compatible with the OpenAI Files / Vector Stores API), while sending everything else to a default backend |
