# Examples

Configuration examples organized by category.

## Running an Example

```console
cargo run -p praxis-ai-proxy -- -c examples/configs/openai/responses/full-flow-agentic.yaml
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

Configs use local ports (`3000`, `3001`, ...) for
upstreams — start a real backend or stub on those ports
before sending requests.

## Configs

### General

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| [a2a-agent-card-routing.yaml](configs/a2a-agent-card-routing.yaml) | Routes agent card discovery requests to dedicated backends |
| [a2a-classifier-routing.yaml](configs/a2a-classifier-routing.yaml) | Routes A2A requests by body-derived method, family, context ID, task ID, and streaming detection |
| [a2a-task-routing.yaml](configs/a2a-task-routing.yaml) | Captures task and context ownership from SendMessage JSON responses and SendStreamingMessage / SubscribeToTask SSE responses, then routes follow-up requests back to the backend cluster that created the task or owns the context |
| [ai-inference-body-based-routing.yaml](configs/ai-inference-body-based-routing.yaml) | Routes LLM API requests to different backends based on the `model` field in the JSON request body |
| [aws-sigv4.yaml](configs/aws-sigv4.yaml) | Signs outbound requests to an AWS service (Bedrock, in this example) using Signature Version 4. Credentials are static, sourced from environment variables — see the module docs on Sigv4SignFilter for the planned OIDC/default-credential-chain follow-up |
| [azure-ad.yaml](configs/azure-ad.yaml) | Acquires an Entra ID bearer token via the client-credentials grant and injects "Authorization: Bearer <token>" on every proxied request to Azure OpenAI |
| [credential-injection.yaml](configs/credential-injection.yaml) | Injects per-cluster API credentials into upstream requests and strips client-provided credentials to prevent forwarding |
| [external-metering.yaml](configs/external-metering.yaml) | Pre-request balance check and post-response token usage reporting against an external metering service |
| [gcp-adc.yaml](configs/gcp-adc.yaml) | Acquires an OAuth2 access token from the GCE/GKE metadata server (source: adc or metadata) and injects "Authorization: Bearer <token>" on every proxied request to Vertex AI |
| [identity-header-guard.yaml](configs/identity-header-guard.yaml) | Captures identity headers matching a prefix into filter metadata and strips them before forwarding upstream |
| [intelligent-route-all-capabilities.yaml](configs/intelligent-route-all-capabilities.yaml) | Demonstrates every candidate capability and selection input handled by intelligent_route today |
| [intelligent-route-inference.yaml](configs/intelligent-route-inference.yaml) | Routes requests to different upstream clusters based on the inference model name extracted from a configured request header.  The header value is set by an earlier filter such as `json_body_field` |
| [intelligent-route-mcp.yaml](configs/intelligent-route-mcp.yaml) | Routes MCP `tools/call` requests to the cluster that owns the requested tool, using the `mcp.name` metadata set by the `mcp` filter |
| [intelligent-route-overlay.yaml](configs/intelligent-route-overlay.yaml) | Routes requests using a routing overlay file (`routing-overlay.json`) instead of inline YAML candidates.  The overlay is rendered by the operator into a Kubernetes ConfigMap and projected as a volume mount |
| [json-rpc-routing.yaml](configs/json-rpc-routing.yaml) | Routes JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to different backends based on the "method" field in the JSON request body |
| [lakera-guard.yaml](configs/lakera-guard.yaml) | Screens every request body through Lakera Guard for content moderation before forwarding to the upstream |
| [llmd-ext-proc-routing.yaml](configs/llmd-ext-proc-routing.yaml) | A real llm-d EPP or test processor returns the trusted x-gateway-destination-endpoint header |
| [llmisvc-model-provider-resolver.yaml](configs/llmisvc-model-provider-resolver.yaml) | Rewrites publisher-ID body `model` values to the short model name for LLMISvc / KServe routing; the routing header (default `X-Model`) is left unchanged so routing can still use the publisher ID |

| [model-to-header-routing.yaml](configs/model-to-header-routing.yaml) | Routes LLM API requests to different backends based on the "model" field in the JSON request body |
| [nemo-guardrails-response.yaml](configs/nemo-guardrails-response.yaml) | Evaluates upstream responses against a NeMo Guardrails service |
| [nemo-guardrails.yaml](configs/nemo-guardrails.yaml) | Evaluates incoming requests against a NeMo Guardrails service |
| [prompt-enrichment.yaml](configs/prompt-enrichment.yaml) | Injects system messages into OpenAI-compatible chat completion requests before forwarding to the upstream provider |
| [provider-route.yaml](configs/provider-route.yaml) | This listener requires downstream mTLS. `peer_identity_trust` authenticates and authorizes the edge gateway before AI-owned x-ai-routing-* fields can influence provider-local routing |
| [state-owner-headers.yaml](configs/state-owner-headers.yaml) | Demonstrates the production boundary used when an external authenticator injects separate tenant and subject headers. `state_owner` consumes those assertions into an immutable internal owner and strips the inbound copies. `state_owner_headers` then recreates destination-specific headers from that normalized context |
| [stream-usage-inject.yaml](configs/stream-usage-inject.yaml) | Ensures every streaming OpenAI Chat Completions request carries stream_options.include_usage = true so the upstream response includes token usage in the final SSE event |
| [time-to-first-token.yaml](configs/time-to-first-token.yaml) | Measures the elapsed time from request receipt to the first non-empty SSE body chunk and records a praxis_ai_ttft_seconds Prometheus histogram labeled by model |
| [token-counting.yaml](configs/token-counting.yaml) | Extracts token usage from AI inference responses (streaming and non-streaming) and makes counts available to downstream filters via filter metadata as token.input, token.output, and token.total |
| [token-rate-limit-mixed-algorithms.yaml](configs/token-rate-limit-mixed-algorithms.yaml) | Extends token-rate-limit.yaml with per-rule algorithm choice (ai#789 / praxis#551): each rule in `rules:` independently picks sliding_window or token_bucket, matched by a static header value. team-alpha gets an exact trailing-window budget; team-beta gets a continuously-refilling bucket |
| [token-rate-limit.yaml](configs/token-rate-limit.yaml) | Reserves an estimated token cost at admission time and reconciles that reservation against actual provider-reported usage once the response completes |
| [token-usage-headers.yaml](configs/token-usage-headers.yaml) | Inject Praxis-Token-Input, Praxis-Token-Output, and Praxis-Token-Total headers into downstream responses when token counts are available in filter metadata |

### Anthropic

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| [full-flow-agentic.yaml](configs/anthropic/full-flow-agentic.yaml) | A single Anthropic Messages gateway that runs the server-owned web-search loop through Praxis core's iterative_request_router (IRR) and serves BOTH streaming and buffered clients from one pipeline. `anthropic_web_search` selects the transport per request from the client's `stream` flag (`terminal_streaming: true`) |
| [messages-protocol.yaml](configs/anthropic/messages-protocol.yaml) | Routes Anthropic Messages API requests to a native `/v1/messages` backend |

| [unified-gateway.yaml](configs/anthropic/unified-gateway.yaml) | Routes traffic by classifier-promoted headers so a single listener handles Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses requests |

### Azure

| File | Description |

### OpenAI

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| [conversations.yaml](configs/openai/conversations/conversations.yaml) | Local /v1/conversations endpoints for conversation lifecycle, backed by the ConversationItemStore |
| [embeddings-routing.yaml](configs/openai/embeddings/embeddings-routing.yaml) | Routes OpenAI Embeddings API requests to a dedicated Embeddings API backend |
| [operation-classifier.yaml](configs/openai/operation-classifier.yaml) | Identifies supported OpenAI operations from the request head — method, normalized path, and protocol headers — and publishes the result so a pipeline can branch on a proxy-owned fact instead of a path prefix |
| [prompts-routing.yaml](configs/openai/prompts/prompts-routing.yaml) | Routes OpenAI Prompts API requests to a dedicated Prompts API backend |
| [agentic-loop-deferred-mcp-fixture.yaml](configs/openai/responses/agentic-loop-deferred-mcp-fixture.yaml) | Minimal agentic-loop pipeline that sanitizes deferred MCP connectors on the first inference round. `defer_loading: true` skips `tools/list`, so replay never opens an independent MCP callout |
| [agentic-loop-fixture.yaml](configs/openai/responses/agentic-loop-fixture.yaml) | Minimal agentic loop pipeline for inference fixture replay |
| [agentic-loop.yaml](configs/openai/responses/agentic-loop.yaml) | Demonstrates the openai_agentic_loop filter with iterative_request_router for step-based model-tool-model looping in the Responses API |
| [body-size-limits.yaml](configs/openai/responses/body-size-limits.yaml) | Demonstrates how raw request body size is enforced across a chain of OpenAI Responses filters that each buffer the request body |
| [compact.yaml](configs/openai/responses/compact.yaml) | Demonstrates compaction after rehydrate, file resolve, and document extract so rewritten current-turn content survives history replacement |
| [doc-extract.yaml](configs/openai/responses/doc-extract.yaml) | Converts `input_file` content parts to `input_text` for inference backends that do not natively support `input_file` (e.g. vLLM, llm-d) |
| [file-resolve.yaml](configs/openai/responses/file-resolve.yaml) | Resolves `file_id` and `file_url` references in Responses API input by fetching file metadata and content, then inlining base64 content as `file_data` or `image_url` before forwarding |
| [file-search-callout.yaml](configs/openai/responses/file-search-callout.yaml) | Demonstrates hosted `file_search` execution under the unified agentic loop (#1046). `openai_agentic_loop` is the sole loop owner: it parses each model response, records the `file_search_call` items it sees as assignments, and publishes the single continuation signal (`action=loop|done`). `openai_file_search_callout` is a pure request-phase dispatcher: at request- body EOS on each IRR re-entry it executes the assigned calls against the vector store and reconciles each item in place, then the owner prepares the next inference request |
| [file-search-chat-completions-fixture.yaml](configs/openai/responses/file-search-chat-completions-fixture.yaml) | Single-upstream fixture configuration for recording the private Chat Completions function representation of a Responses file_search tool |

| [format-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/format-routing.yaml) | Routes AI API traffic by detected body format |
| [full-flow-agentic.yaml](configs/openai/responses/full-flow-agentic.yaml) | Runs the complete Responses API pipeline through an agentic iterative_request_router that executes hosted file_search, web_search, and MCP tool calls in a model-tool-model loop, persisting both buffered and streaming (`stream: true`) responses |
| [irr-terminal-streaming.yaml](configs/openai/responses/irr-terminal-streaming.yaml) | Demonstrates a single-step iterative_request_router pipeline that exposes a native OpenAI Responses SSE body incrementally. `openai_responses_proxy` always advertises the streaming capability and selects Praxis's typed streaming transport automatically for an effective `"stream": true` request; there is no operator opt-in |
| [mcp-dispatch.yaml](configs/openai/responses/mcp-dispatch.yaml) | Demonstrates the `openai_mcp_dispatch` filter configuration |
| [mcp-tool-resolve.yaml](configs/openai/responses/mcp-tool-resolve.yaml) | Demonstrates the `openai_mcp_tool_resolve` filter, which resolves MCP tool entries in the Responses API `tools` array into concrete tool definitions by calling `tools/list` on each upstream MCP server |
| [model-rewrite.yaml](configs/openai/responses/model-rewrite.yaml) | Rewrites or injects the top-level `model` field in Responses API request bodies before forwarding to the inference backend |
| [rehydrate-fixture.yaml](configs/openai/responses/rehydrate-fixture.yaml) | Minimal native OpenAI Responses pipeline that stores a first turn, rehydrates a stored `previous_response_id` into the outbound `input` history, and proxies to a native /v1/responses backend |
| [rehydrate.yaml](configs/openai/responses/rehydrate.yaml) | Validates `previous_response_id` by fetching the stored response, confirming its status is completed, and promoting the ID to filter metadata |
| [request-validate.yaml](configs/openai/responses/request-validate.yaml) | Validates Responses API JSON and enriches request metadata |
| [response-store.yaml](configs/openai/responses/response-store.yaml) | Persists non-streaming Responses API responses to a database and serves stored data via GET endpoints and handles DELETE /v1/responses/{id} locally |
| [responses-proxy.yaml](configs/openai/responses/responses-proxy.yaml) | Proxies OpenAI Responses API requests to a native /v1/responses backend |
| [responses-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/responses-routing.yaml) | Routes Responses API traffic by detected mode |
| [responses-to-chat-completions.yaml](configs/openai/responses/responses-to-chat-completions.yaml) | Accepts OpenAI Responses create requests, including finite stored continuations, while targeting a backend that only implements /v1/chat/completions |
| [stream-events.yaml](configs/openai/responses/stream-events.yaml) | Demonstrates the `openai_stream_events` filter, which composes the current iterative-request-router (IRR) execution into one logical Responses SSE stream: it parses each backend SSE chunk, accumulates state (response object, output items, tool calls, usage) into ResponsesState, normalizes the per-round lifecycle, and preserves parser state through stream completion |
| [tool-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/tool-routing.yaml) | Demonstrates using `openai_tool_parse` to route Responses API requests by their tool composition |
| [vector-stores-routing.yaml](configs/openai/responses/vector-stores-routing.yaml) | Routes /v1/vector_stores traffic and all its subresources to a dedicated backend (any server compatible with the OpenAI Files / Vector Stores API), while sending everything else to a default backend |
| [vllm-agentic-api.yaml](configs/openai/responses/vllm-agentic-api.yaml) | vLLM Agentic API: https://github.com/vllm-project/agentic-api |
| [web-search-chat-completions-fixture.yaml](configs/openai/responses/web-search-chat-completions-fixture.yaml) | Single-upstream fixture configuration for recording the private Chat Completions function representation of a Responses web_search tool |
| [web-search-chat-completions.yaml](configs/openai/responses/web-search-chat-completions.yaml) | Accepts OpenAI Responses requests with hosted web search while targeting a backend that only implements /v1/chat/completions |
| [web-search.yaml](configs/openai/responses/web-search.yaml) | Demonstrates the `openai_web_search` filter configuration |

### Payload Processing

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| [mcp-static-catalog.yaml](configs/payload-processing/mcp-static-catalog.yaml) | Provides a static MCP catalog and broker for initialize, tools/list, ping, and notifications/initialized requests |
